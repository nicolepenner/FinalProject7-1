# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, has a successful application currently available for Android phones. The client is looking to expand and develop a web-based version of the gaming app that is available on multiple platforms. CTS needed to set up the environment and create the web-based version of the gaming app.


# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did an extensive amount of research to be able to make the best educated suggestion I could to The Gaming Room. I also kept the software design document clear, concise, and free of errors. Overall, I think I was able to efficiently write each piece of the document will a background of knowledge that helped me write the best software design document possible.


# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I felt that by having the formatted document it was easy to stay on task and know what needed to go in each section. I felt that I was able to better answer each task on the design document by having it laid out. Next time I need to write a design document I will know how to write one which will be extremely helpful.


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I had the most difficulty with my final recommendations. Since there were benefits and drawbacks of each choice, it was difficult for me to choose. If I could do it again, I would hope that I could have a little more information to make the most informed recommendation possible for the client.


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user is ultimately who will be using the software in the end. It is important to consider what the user will think and if they will be happy with the end goal. Since user’s are already used to playing the app that is on Android, there is a level of expectation of how the web-based version will function. The user needs to have a program they are happy with since they will use it, and will need to continue to use it for the client to have a successful product. 


# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I looked at what the end goal was, and broke the program apart into pieces to write the code as efficiently as possible. I will use the software design document as a base in the future to better analyze and write a program. It was helpful to see the design document to know all the details of the program without having to flip back and forth to see all the information about the program.
